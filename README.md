# Assessment tasks

1. The calculator has many functions implemented in JavaScript already, but they need to be connected to the HTML interface in order to make it interactive. Modify the HTML code so that the calculator starts working.

1. The calculator has some basic layout applied, but hasn't been fully styled. Customise the CSS to make it more attractive/interesting.

1. The "DEL" button should remove the last typed symbol, but the relevant function hasn't been implemented. Complete the JavaScript function responsible for this feature.

1. The calculator can accept keyboard input as well as mouse clicks, but the code contains a bug that means the division using the keyboard doesn't work. Fix the calculator so the "/" key will be recognised as the division operator.
